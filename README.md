        <p>Something excited happened.I learned the basics of html and css from Kahn Academy and Zenva Academy. I combined both to get a better understanding of html and css. I'm also planning to incorporate codeacademy too.
        </p>
        <p>I hope to learn a bit more web developmentto see if I'm interested in it as a career path. If not, I hope to use these sources to see other pathways. Kotlin coding for android sounds intresting for now. Coding for vr apps also sounds intresting.</p>

        <p>Studied some web dev, html and css. Had a study plan with my friend. He is studying his own thing while I am too. We study for 1 hour and 1/2 . After that we game for 15 mins. We repeat that twice until the third break. That third break is 30min seesion. This studying method helps so we dont burn out.</p>

        <p>So far, studying HTML and CSS can be quite an adventure, especially when you're diving into it with a positive mindset. It's like being a digital explorer, navigating through the building blocks of the web. HTML provides the structure, much like the skeleton of a building, while CSS adds style, giving life to the design with colors and layouts. As I learn more, I'll eventually find that you can create not just web pages, but whole experiences(with javascript), eventually crafting sites that are entertaining, functional, and pleasing to the eyes.
